# [lsty](http://lsty.heroku.com) #
Listy is a simple Sinatra app for creating lists that are shareable via
url. As long as someone has the url of a list, they may edit it as they
see fit.

## Purpose ##
Listy was created to be a playground for a few technologies that I have
not yet tried (mongoDB, HAML, Sinatra, Heroku).

## Current progress ##
Check out the [issue page](https://github.com/markscholtz/listy/issues)
